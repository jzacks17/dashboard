# dashboard

Dashboard webpage to display my (Josh Zacks') previous Odin Project projects. 

The header and sidebar of the page are non-functional and are present as display only. Clicking on any of the projects in the project section will take you to a live webpage of that project. The announcements section is filled with lorem ipsum text. 

Webpage was created with HTML and CSS.
